# âœ… Prometheus has been installed and started as a system service.
#
# ðŸ‘‰ Next steps for proper configuration and management:
#
# 1. Review and customize the config at: /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
#    - Add more scrape jobs, alerting rules, remote write, etc.
#    - https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/
#
# 2. Secure access:
#    - Run behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for HTTPS/auth
#    - Or use experimantal basic authentication and TLS
#    - https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/https/
#
# 3. Monitor Prometheus itself:
#    - It exposes metrics at http://localhost:9090/metrics
#
# 4. Add exporters (e.g., Node Exporter) to monitor system metrics.
